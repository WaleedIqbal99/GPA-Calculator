/*This program calculate the GPA of the user. It starts off by prompting the user to enter all the information needed
 * to do so while error checking him with error messages. After acquiring the needed information, the user gets an option
 * menu which he can choose from. With option 1, the user can get his current GPA, credits and the courses with their info.
 * Option 2 calculates the new GPA. Option 3 allows the user to delete a course while option 4 lets the user add one. Finally,
 * option 5 exits the program. The user can choose an option as many times as he desires until he chooses to exit.
